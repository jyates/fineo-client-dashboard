# Admin panel framework based on Angular 2, Bootstrap 4 and Webpack

Admin template made with :heart:  by [Akveo team](http://akveo.com/). Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/akveo_inc) to get latest news about this template first!

## Building and Running

Get started by installing the dependencies
```
$ npm install
```

### Development

Start the development (local) server.
```
$ npm run server:dev
```

Supports hot-module-replacement and watches the `src/` directory for continuous updates.

### Production

This is entirely a static app powered by backend API. Therefore, we just need to run a simple httpserver to serve the content.

```
npm start
```

### Heroku

Building with Heroku (or in a Heroku-like environment) requires the following environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=production
```

Then you can build the static distribution with:

```
npm run heroku-postbuild
```

Hint: this is is kicked off by heroku in without any extra configuration.
